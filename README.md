Here I will share some projects that are related to Front End development. These are older projects, as my interest lies in backend development, however I have sufficient knowledge and experience to work with HTML, CSS, Javascript if required. Looking back, it was a slower time, no GPTs or AI, just pure grit and lust for knowledge.

Over the years I have worked on lots of other projects involving FE, some for fun, some for jobs that I held.
